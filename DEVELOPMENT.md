# Caphne.co Development
Development should be thought of in terms of user experience first. Therefore frontend proceeds all else. The backend & DB is then build to store the data and serves frontend experience. User experience-first development is the philosophy of this project. No technical decision is final.

Each developer is expected to do a little bit of designing. We could either cover the feature ourselves end-to-end or split it into reasonable small tasks and work on it with other devs.
